# VirtualPlayer
Virtually playing music over network!!!

Ever thought of **Playing Music files without actually saving it in your mobile**. There comes Virtual Player to support this idea.
Confusing, isn't it???

Possibilities:-
* When your phone doesn't have enough storage to accomodate music files(Just Saying :P).
* When your phone doesn't have a better loud speaker or the quality has been degraded.

What Virtual player actually does is that streaming of music files(.mp3) over network using WiFi Hotspot. 

When your Friend(Server) starts the Hotspot, You(Client) can connect to it. 

Next process is simple. Your friend shares all his music files to you and then you can play and listen to it peacefully!!!
Cool, isn't it??? :P
